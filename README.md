# Matplotlib Project

This project contains several scripts and files for creating and visualizing data using the Matplotlib library. The following files are included:

- `gui.py`: A GUI application for generating and customizing plots using Matplotlib.
- `main.py`: A script for creating a basic plot using Matplotlib.
- `config.py`: A configuration file for setting default plot parameters.
- `data.csv`: A sample CSV file containing data for use in the scripts.
- `output/`: A directory for storing output files generated by the scripts.

## Usage

To use the GUI application, run the `gui.py` script: 
"python gui.py"

This will create a basic plot using the data in `data.csv` and the default settings specified in `config.py`.

## Customization

To customize the default plot parameters, edit the values in `config.py`.

To customize the appearance of the plots generated by the GUI application, use the options provided in the GUI.

## Output

Output files generated by the scripts will be saved in the `output/` directory.
